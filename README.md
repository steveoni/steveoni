### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stephen Oni, and I have experience crafting software using tools spanning web development, backend systems, data science, and machine learning. I was once deeply interested in bringing machine learning training (not just inference) to the web, which influenced the open-source projects I created or contributed to. However, my focus has now shifted to getting closer to the metal and understanding low-level systems.
